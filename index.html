		<h2 id="mydescription">
			Hello! My name is Nicholas Hong. I’m a Computer Science student and tutor at Ohlone College. 
			I have worked on the Internet of Things and embedded devices such as one at Scanit Technology. 
			In the future, I hope to become a Software Engineer working on back-end or front-end programming.
			With my newly found hobby, soldering, I plan doing fun at-home projects with Arduinos and Raspberry Pis.
			In my free time, I enjoy playing tennis, cup stacking, and bowling. I also take pleasure in going around 
			the Bay Area trying out different teas and coffee shops as well as creating my own caffeinated concoctions.
			When stuck indoors, I love listening and playing music from my small, but growing, collection of instruments
			such as the piano, violin, clarinet, etc.

		<p id="proj1info">At Scanit Technology, our mission is to improve the quality of life. I worked on a project called SENSE, which is a stand-alone product that 
		goes in pair with SporeCam, a pathogen detector and Scanit's main product. At this company, I gained experience working on embedded devices and learned to design schematic and circuitry as well as
		implementing BLE and Cloud services.</p>

		<p id="proj3info">This was a game I made using Unity. This was a short summer project to learn some basic game designing and character modeling. It is a 2d side scrolling Super Mario Bros clone.
		The main character is a Macoroni who uses noodle weapons. He is able to pick up different weapons and change them. 
		The overall objective is to defeat all the enemies and make it to the end goal 
		without getting hit. </p>

			<p id="work1info" class="workinfo"> This is a web-based minesweeper clone with potatos as mines written in C++ and HTML using CGI. On a 10x10 grid, the player can choose either to flag the potatoes or to dig a hole. 
			The game ends if the user flags all 10 potatoes or if they dig up a potato. The user can use up to 10 flags.</p>
